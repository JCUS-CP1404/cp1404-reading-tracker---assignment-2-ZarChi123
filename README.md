_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
...  
Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)
I started my project on 12 January 2023 and continuously work on it progressively until the due date.Each time I work on my project,I focus on chunks of projects.Each time I work on this project, it took me about 5hours 16 minutes according to WakaTime to complete each chunk of the project.I work on the assingment for 11 days , not continiously therefore it took me total of about 55hours + to complete the whole project.

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
I was most satisfied with my GUI program about how it turned out.AFter careful intricate testing on each function of the project , when the output turns out right,
I get a very good satisfaction.When working on my main.py, I was really happy knowing that my spinner and buttons turn out to align well and the colour of the buttons also matched the sample output.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?


## 4. What worked well in your development process?
...

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?


## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
I use the lecture slides uploaded in learnJCU, for further understanding I also make use of websites such as stackoverflow to find the meaning of the errors I faced and use the knowledge of how other coders solved these issues to overcome my own.
The another great resource that helped me with the GUI part was the kivy demos which my lecturer has uploaded which samples the different parts of kivy such as using spinner and creating buttons.Based on these demos, I have constructed my own kivy/GUI program.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
The challenge that I faced mainly was that my program keeps crashing in the main.py while working on my GUI program.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
